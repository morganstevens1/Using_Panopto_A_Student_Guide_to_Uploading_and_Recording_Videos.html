        Using Panopto: A Student Guide to Uploading and Recording Videos
    </h3>
    <h4>
        Overview
    </h4>
    <p>
        Panopto, Bryn Mawr's lecture capture system, is a great resource for students-enabling people to quickly
        record presentations or lectures and post the recordings for classmates to review (e.g. the ability to
        specifically post PowerPoint or Keynote presentations). Not only that, but Panopto also offers features
        that help make the recordings themselves more interactive (e.g. 
        <a href = "https://howtovideos.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Auth/Login.aspx?Auth=Viewer&ReturnUrl=%2fPanopto%2fPages%2fEmbed.aspx%3fid%3d5728357e-7682-4ba6-9739-a7067145bc78%26query%3dQuiz">

    <h4>
        What will I need Panopto for?
    </h4>
    <p>
        Regarding Panopto and coursework, it's likely that professors request that students use the software to either:
        <ol>
            <li>
                View pre-recorded, narrated lectures and foster discussions around them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Record or upload a narrated presentation as a course assignment. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        To access the software, students can either head Bryn Mawr's online panopto platform directly at
        <a href="https://brynmawr.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Auth/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fbrynmawr.hosted.panopto.com%2FPanopto%2FPages%2FHome.aspx">

                A Quick Note Regarding Bi-Co Access:
            </u>
        </strong>
        All Bryn Mawr students should be able to access Panopto using their usual BMC login credentials. This applies to Haverford students who are
        registered for bryn Mawr courses as well. Since Haverford students are given BMC credentials to use when registering and Panopto logs students
        in through Moodle (thus, by extension, their Bryn Mawr login credentials), Haverford students should have little trouble accessing the software.
        However, all students who run into issues launching/downloading or using Panopto, should
        <a href= mailto:help@brynmawr.edu>
            the Bryn Mawr College Help Desk
        </a>
        for assistance.

    <h3>
        Recording & Uploading
    </h3>
    <p>
        When getting ready to record, ensure that you have:
        <ol>
            <li>
                A computer (preferably with a built-in webcam)
            </li>
            <li>
                A reliable internet connection
            </li>
            <li>
                Successfully installed the Panopto Desktop App onto the computer you will be using to record.
                (Check out these links for instructions on how to freely download and install the software.

    <h3>
        Starting a Recording
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Login to your computer and open any applications and files that you will use to during your recording.
            For example, if you wanted to show Powerpoint slides, a web page, and an image in a PDF document, you would open your
            PowerPoint file, your web browser, and the PDF file.
            <b>
                Panopto will use all of the RAM, cache space, and processing power available when it is launched. Opening your presentation
                materials before opening Panopto ensures that computer resources are reserved for those processes.
            </b>
        </li>
        <li>
            Launch the Panopto recorder, of which there are two options to do so. You can either:
            1) open the Panopto desktop app that you installed onto your computer or 2) login via

            Uploading External Videos into Panopto

            In addition to using Panopto to record lecutres, presentations, or talks at home (see 
            <a href="https://techdocs.blogs.brynmawr.edu/7192">

                students can also upload vidoes created or recoreded elsewhere into Panopto
            </b>
            to share them with others. This can be done by uploading the video to Panopto from any computer
            (Mac or PC). This is a great way to add interactive features to pre-existing videos that you want to
            use for an assignment!
